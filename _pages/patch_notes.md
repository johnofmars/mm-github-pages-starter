## Patch notes:

[Update 3.4.0](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50880) - _30th Anniversary Patch_
  - Fighting Lion
    - Removed the multi-hit requirement (i.e. dealing any damage will grant the buff).
    - Increased the buff to the reload stat from +50 to +70.
    "Reload will still be slow if you miss, but if you land any damage Fighting Lion will reload faster than it did before the nerf."
    - Increased the buff duration to 7s.

[Patch note preview for 30th Anniversary Patch:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/qd27mx/comment/hhjw72u/?context=3)

"Got in touch with the team, here's some info straight from their keyboards:

> Fighting Lion wasn't a specific problem before we reworked the weapon, but given increasing frustration with breech grenade launchers in crucible it seemed like a misstep to say "we hear you" and "here's an infinite ammo version of that thing you're frustrated about" in the same patch
> It has become clear through hands on, feedback, and backend data that the full nerf isn't needed, so we're adjusting it in the 30th Anniversary patch

> **Note:** This is not a full rollback - there's still a difference between "almost infinite ammo" and "actually infinite ammo" in how weapons are used, so we want to make sure we don't create a monster.

Here's a quick patchnote preview for December:

- Removed the multi-hit requirement for the reload speed buff
- Increased the buff to the reload stat
- i.e. reload will still be slow if you miss, but if you land any damage Fighting Lion will reload faster than it did before the nerf"

[Update 3.3.0](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50599) - _Season of the Lost (15) patch_

- Breech Grenade Launchers
  - Reduced blast radius by 0.4m, e.g. max blast radius decreased from 4.55m to 4.15m, min blast radius decreased from 3.80m to 3.40m.
  - Reduced splash damage by 20, which reduces total damage for a direct hit from 220 to 200 (before taking spike or proximity grenades into account).
  - Increased damage in PvE by 12%.

- Fighting Lion
  - Fighting Lion ammo increased from "a lot" to "infinite."
  - Receives the same changes as other breech Grenade Launchers.
    - (editor's note: Special GLs had damage reduced by 20, Fighting Lion had it reduced by 16)
  - Reduced base reload stat to 0.
    - (editor's note: Catalyst still gives a +27 reload bump)
    - (editors' note 2: reload stat really lowered to 10)
  - Now increases reload speed to its previous level on damaging multiple enemies with one grenade.

Discussion of changes [in the TWAB here.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50572)

- Fighting Lion has always been fun but not dominant in PvE, so we weren't worried about the impact infinite ammo would have there. However enabling fast, unlimited grenade spamming was too much in PvP based on internal playtests, so we've addressed that specific case without significantly impacting its feel in PvE.

  - Fighting Lion reserve ammo increased from "a lot" to "infinite."
  - Receives the same changes as other breech Grenade Launchers.
  - Reduced base reload stat to 0 (breech Grenade Launchers with 0 reload stat reload very, very slowly).
  - Now increases reload speed to its previous level on damaging multiple enemies with one grenade.
  - We'll be keeping an eye on this, but believe it's in a good place with this change (and note that we're not going to over-nerf an Exotic with its own subreddit).
  - You shouldn't be manually reloading Fighting Lion anyway.
