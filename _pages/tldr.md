**Getting Started** was just the sales pitch, but what if you're not ready for 7,000 words of **Mastery** detail?

Here is your **too long; didn't read**.

## The Gun

- Always hip-fire.
- Always hold to fire, release to detonate.
- Like all tube grenade launchers, it's a Lightweight Frame, and thus it gives a mobility bonus.

- **Thin the Herd, the exotic perk**, is 3 perks in one:
  - Do extra damage to enemy shields (bonus damage doesn't work in Crucible or on Arc shields)
  - Killing any enemy with non-**Lion** damage shortly after dealing damage with Lion refills Lion's magazine (Helps maintain uptime)
  - Kills with **Lion** always drop ammo. (It's enough to completely refill your reserves.)

- **Masterworking**:
  - New perk **Chimera**, gives your kinetic `Quickdraw`, `Snapshot Sights` _and_ `Opening Shot` for 3 seconds.
  - Masterworking also gives you a 50% increase in reload speed.
  - And it makes orbs on multi-kills, which nearly all of your PvE kills will be.


## PvP

- Damage: 142 splash, 26 direct hit.
- **Lion** has good hip fire and air accuracy. Be mobile. Use vertical space.
- **Lion** does massive burst damage and is well-suited for team-shooting.
- Dealing damage to targets that you cant see (and vice versa) gives you and your team a health advantage without putting you at risk. This is the greatest strength of **Fighting Lion**.

># Bank! Those! Shots!

- Double primaries is very viable and starves your enemies of special ammo.
- Fighting Lion is weak in close range due to the minimum delay on manual detonation and difficulty of direct hits.

>**Close Range:** Make sure you cover this weakness!!!
{: .notice--warning}

## PvE

- The gun may be "90" rpm, but in practice, it's gated by reload speed. Actual fire rate is ~42 rpm.
- You can [invert the Lion combo](/the_gun/#pve-only-inverted-lion) in PvE only:
  - Fire your kinetic, then get a lion kill to instantly refill your lion.
- Focus on multi-kills and staying mobile.
- Lion is bad for sustained DPS, so open with it, then swap to your DPS for beefy targets.

## Weapon Pairings

- You don't need `Quickdraw`, `Snapshot Sights` _and_ `Opening Shot`
  - So use perks like `Kill Clip`, `Rampage`, ` Vorpal`, `Autoloading Holster`, `Hipfire Grip`, etc.
- **Lion** is a solid mid-range weapon, so make your choice around that. It is very flexible.
  - Shotguns, Side-arms, SMGs for close range.
  - Hand cannons for close/mid.
  - Snipers for long range.
- For PvP, [follow-up damage](/pairings/#archetypes) is very important!
  - Fast firing, lower damage is forgiving, but on average slower.
  - Slow, big damage is faster, but unforgiving.
- For PvE, consider **Lion** like any other primary and bring a special weapon of your choice.

## Loadout

- `1x Grenade Launcher Loader` (non-enhanced) gets you 80% of the way to the reload cap.
- `Dire Artillery` (the equivalent of `Pump Action`/`Remote Connection`) _does_ work for **Fighting Lion**.
- You don't need dexterity perks for your primary, because of **Chimera**.
- Grenade Launcher `Scavenger` & `Reserves` don't help much for **Fighting Lion** (1-2 extra rounds)
  - Remember that `Thin the Herd` perk will completely refill your reserves with a single white ammo box on kill.
- Exotic armors that benefit reloading/ability-synergies/mobility or damage-utility are great choices.
  - My favorites are **Nezarec's Sins**, **Transversive Steps**, **Sunbracers**, **Synthoceps**, **Dragon's Shadow**.
- Focus on subclasses with high mobility and strong grenade or melee options (depending on your preferences)
