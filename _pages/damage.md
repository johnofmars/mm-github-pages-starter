### Damage Against Titan Barricades

In patch 2.8.0, Titan Barricades have been given increased health to 600 hp, but now take 30% extra damage from Grenade Launchers.

This means that Lion rounds now do 166 splash and 29 direct hit damage or 195 total, so it will take four (4) Lion rounds to break a shield.

Crucially, the damage numbers against the shield are precision yellow. This means that when you fire a shot around a shield, you can now distinguish between the damage the Titan is taking and the shield is taking.

### Damage vs each Super

**Self-Damage & Point Blank Damage**

You can't see damage numbers against yourself, but point-blank and perfect return damage to you (**cough** Antaneus Wards **cough**) will do the same 168 perfect damage you would do to an opponent. It looks like this:
