Refer to the Armor: Mods & Stats for detailed discussion of each option. Here will we put it all together.

This page will evaluate two things:
- Non-Seasonal builds (choices from the first 3 armor slots)
- Charged with Light (Season of Dawn (8) or Arrivals (11))

#Witch Queen Build for Void 3.0

[Fighting Lion can both apply and detonate `Volatile` targets!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/FightingLion/comments/t3zd5y/fighting_lion_has_some_very_interesting/)

[Here is a video for folks to see it in action.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/947262151201022002/948330145305989120/LION_BOOM.mp4)

## Charged with Light Build (CwL)

Charged with Light is a really strong system that synergizes well with Lion. Unfortunately, it's a bit obtuse.

Every CwL build has needs a builder to get charges, a spender to get the benefit and _can_ have modifiers that give extra stacks or share charges with allies.
- Builder (Green icon)
- Spender (Yellow icon)
- Modifier (White icon)

**Standard Build**

The Standard build is all about getting the 20% damage boost from **High Energy Fire** and keeping it up at all times.

{% include feature_row %}

A solid 4th choice is **Protective Light** (2 void)
> When the player character is Charged with Light, they gain significant damage resistance when their shields are destroyed, consuming all stacks of Charged with Light. The more stacks consumed, the longer the damage resistance lasts.

**Empowering Build:**

Empowering builds instead of keeping 1-2 stacks, instead works to build a higher cap of Charges to empower a specific spender.

* Charger: Blast Radius  (3 Solar)
* Raise charge cap: Supercharged (5 Solar)
* Bonus Damage Spenders:
    - Swords (Lucent Blade - 4 Arc)
    - Sidearms (Surprise Attack - 5 Solar)
    - Super (Energy Converter - 4 Void)

So in summary, you always have Blast Radius & Protective Light. For Lion focused neutral game: Stacks on Stacks with High Energy Fire. For any other build, it's raising the charge cap with Supercharged and then specific mod you want (sword, sidearm, super).
